# ShirtCostCalculator

This Python code encompasses functions for calculating the larger of two numbers and determining the cost of shirts based on their type and quantity. The `mx` function employs the `max()` function to find the greater number. The `cotton` and `silk` functions calculate costs for cotton and silk shirts, respectively, considering the quantity ordered. The `main` function coordinates the program, allowing users to input integers and choose shirt type and quantity. It then computes and displays the larger number, as well as the total cost for the chosen shirt type and quantity. The code assists users in comparing numbers and estimating shirt costs, streamlining decision-making.
